Gamma: "It is important to note that the selection of the value 2.6 has nothing to do with the physics or electronics of any display device. The decision was made based on the ability to encode the luminance values at a modulation that will not limit the quality of the encoded images. Although the emphasis has been on a 5000:1 sequential contrast, the gamma value of 2.6 will not be a limiting factor in image quality, even if a future projector were to reach a sequential contrast of 1,000,000:1

* The Key Delivery Message (KDM) is an XML document that contains cryptographic information necessary to reproduce an encrypted composition. A KDM also contains metadata about the cryptographic information, such as the validity period and the associated Composition Playlist (CPL). The format of the KDM file is specified by [SMPTE-430-1-2006]. A KDM is a type of Extra-Theater Message (ETM), as specified by [SMPTE-430-3-2008].
